I've a frequent user of Google Calender/Task. And since I own an Android phone, the combination became even more productive.

But there's something I would like to achieve on Task/Calender is to keep a list of completed task/calender entries without cluttering my yet to be done list.

This software is suppose to overcome the problem by journalizing each expired/completed entries at put them under a diff calendar, which I named it "Journal".

Read my [InitialThought](InitialThought.md) to have a better picture of this.
