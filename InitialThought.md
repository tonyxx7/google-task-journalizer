# Introduction #
I've a frequent user of Google Calender/Task. And since I own an Android phone, the combination became even more productive.

But there's something I would like to achieve inn Task/Calender is to keep a list of completed task/calender entries without cluttering my yet to be done list.

This software is suppose to overcome the problem by journalizing each expired/completed entries and put them under a diff calendar, which I named it "Journal".

Normally I use Google Task to keep all my todo. For example shopping list for this weekend, task from a project, birthday gift. When I've done the shopping I'll normally mark those that's completed. If there's some items which is not done, I'll move them say to the next day. Which I'll do them by then. So the "due date" on the task itself is the date which the task is completed as well. I'm using that to indicate when I've done the task.

But now the list has grown so long that it became unproductive. I don't want to clear them until at least 90 days later so I can refer back whenever I need them. Some task will be kept for at least a year. So imagine scrolling through the long list of completed task.

Yesterday (26/05/2011), while listening to [Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/)'s podcast on the topic of [GTD](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/HanselminutesPodcast234GettingThingsDoneWithLaneNewsom.aspx), an idea suddenly sparked me. It's about archiving email as mentioned in the podcast. So I started thinking why can't we archive tasks on Google Task. That way, I can keep a history of what I have done, at the time keeping my todo list clean and neat.

Later, I realize that it can also be done for Google Calendar's entries. Suddenly I felt the urge to start the project, and can't wait to see the result.
